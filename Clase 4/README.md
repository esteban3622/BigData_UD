# Challenge: Investigate the 90% Accuracy Limit
## Report Your Findings:
Summarize your observations about why the model is limited to 90% accuracy.
Include screenshots or plots (e.g., loss curves, accuracy comparisons, or visualized data) to support your conclusions.
## Experiment Results:
Share the changes you made (if any) to improve accuracy.
Provide before-and-after accuracy metrics and explain why your adjustments worked (or didnâ€™t work).
## Propose Solutions:
Improvement of the current implementation that could help achieve higher accuracy.
